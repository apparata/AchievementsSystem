/// Represents the progress state of an achievement.
///
/// Progress can be expressed in one of several ways:
/// - `locked`: The achievement has not yet started.
/// - `unlocked`: The achievement has been fully completed.
/// - `counted`: Progress measured by an integer count toward a threshold.
/// - `progression`: Progress measured by a floating-point value toward a threshold.
///
/// This enum provides flexibility to represent both discrete and continuous
/// progress tracking for achievements.
